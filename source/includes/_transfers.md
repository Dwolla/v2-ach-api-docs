# Transfers

A transfer represents money being transferred from a `source` to a `destination`. Transfers are available for the `Customer` and `Account` resources.

### Source and destination types

##### Source types

| Source Type | URI | Description |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Funding source | `https://api.dwolla.com/funding-sources/{id}` | A bank or balance funding source. |

##### Destination types

| Destination Type | URI | Description |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Funding source | `https://api.dwolla.com/funding-sources/{id}` | Destination of an Account or verified Customer's own bank or balance funding source. **OR** A Customer's bank funding source. |

### amount JSON object

| Parameter | Required |  Type  | Description            |
|-----------|----------|--------|------------------------|
| value     |   yes    | string | Amount of money. If the entered amount has more than two decimal places, Dwolla will automatically round it to the nearest even integer using [Banker's Rounding](http://wiki.c2.com/?BankersRounding). <br> Maximum limit: Default transaction limits based on [Customer type](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/account-types.html) or custom transaction limits as defined in the services agreement with Dwolla. <br> Minimum limit: $0.01.|

### Facilitator fee JSON object

The facilitator fee is a feature allowing for a flat rate amount to be removed from a payment as a fee, and sent to the creator of the Dwolla application. The fee does not affect the original payment amount, and exists as a separate [Transfer resource](#transfer-resource) with a unique transfer ID. Within a transfer request you can specify an optional `fees` request parameter, which is an array of [fee objects](#facilitator-fee-json-object) that can represent many unique fee transfers.

For more information on collecting fees on payments, reference the [facilitator fee](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/facilitator-fee.html) resource article.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|------------|
|_links | Contains a `charge-to` JSON object with a link to the associated source or destination `Customer` resource. |
|amount | Amount of fee to charge. An amount JSON object. [See above](#amount-json-object) |

#### Facilitator fee example:

```noselect
"fees": [
  {
    "_links": {
      "charge-to": {
        "href": "https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/d795f696-2cac-4662-8f16-95f1db9bddd8"
      }
    },
    "amount": {
      "value": "4.00",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  }
]
```

### clearing JSON object

The `clearing` object is used in tandem with our expedited transfer feature.
Source specifies the clearing time for the source funding source involved in the transfer, and can be used to downgrade the clearing time from the default of Next-day ACH. Destination specifies the clearing time for the destination funding source involved in the transfer, and can be used to upgrade the clearing time from the default of Standard ACH to Same-day ACH.

> **Note:** The clearing request parameter is a premium feature available for [Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com/platform) customers. Enabling Next-day ACH and Same-day ACH requires additional Dwolla approvals before getting started. Please contact [Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs) or your account manager for more information on enabling this account setting.

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|------------|------|-----------|
| source | no | string | Represents a clearing object for `standard` debits into the Dwolla network. Used to downgrade the clearing time from the default of Next-day ACH. <br> Possible values: `standard` |
| destination | no | string | Represents a clearing object for `same-day` credits out of the Dwolla network to a bank funding source. <br> Possible values: `next-available` |

#### Clearing example:

```noselect
"clearing": {
  "source": "standard",
  "destination": "next-available"
}
```

### achDetails and addenda object

**Note: This feature is only supported for business Customer records.** <br> The addendum record is used to provide additional information to the payment recipient about the payment. This value will be passed in on a transfer request and can be exposed on a Customer’s bank statement. Addenda records provide a unique opportunity to supply your customers with more information about their transactions. Allowing businesses to include additional details about the transaction—such as invoice numbers—provides their end users with more information about the transaction in the comfort of their own banking application.

##### achDetails object

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| source | no | object | Represents information that is sent to a source/originating bank account along with a transfer. Include information within this JSON object for customizing details on ACH debit transfers. Can include an [addenda JSON object](#addenda-object). |
| destination | no | object | Represents information that is sent to a destination/receiving bank account along with a transfer. Include information within this JSON object for customizing details on ACH credit transfers. Can include an [addenda JSON object](#addenda-object).|

##### addenda object

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| addenda | no | object | An addenda object contains a `values` key where its value is an array containing a **single** string addenda value. Addenda record information is used for the purpose of transmitting transfer-related information from a business. <br> Addenda value must be less than or equal to 80 characters and can include spaces. <br> Acceptable characters are: a-Z, 0-9, and special characters `- _ . ~ ! * ' ( ) ; : @ & = + $ , / ? % # [ ]`. <br> *Transfers must be sent to/from a business entity's bank to guarantee addenda delivery.* |

#### achDetails with addenda example:

```noselect
"achDetails": {
  "source": {
    "addenda": {
      "values": ["ABC123_AddendaValue"]
    }
  },
  "destination": {
    "addenda": {
      "values": ["ZYX987_AddendaValue"]
    }
  }
}
```

### rtpDetails object

> Note: This is available as part of RTP®, a premium feature available for Dwolla customers. Enabling RTP® does require additional Dwolla approvals before getting started. Please [contact Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs) or your account manager for more information on enabling this account feature.

The `rtpDetails` object is used to provide additional information to the payment recipient about their RTP® credit transfer. This value will be passed in on an RTP® credit transfer request to the recipient’s bank account. 

Refer to our [Real-time Payments developer concept article](https://developers.dwolla.com/concepts/real-time-payments#initiating-an-rtp-credit-transfer) to learn more about initiating an RTP® credit transfer. 

##### rtpDetails object

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |

#### rtpDetails example:

```noselect
"rtpDetails": {
  "destination": {
    "remittanceData": "ABC_123 Remittance Data"
  }
}
```

## Initiate a transfer

This section covers how to initiate a transfer from either a Dwolla [Account](#accounts) or Dwolla API [Customer](#customers) resource.

### Prevent duplicate transfers with idempotency key

To prevent an operation from being performed more than once, Dwolla supports passing in an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique key as the value. Multiple `POSTs` with the same idempotency key won't result in multiple resources being created.

For example, if a request to initiate a transfer fails due to a network connection issue, you can reattempt the request with the same idempotency key to ensure that only a single transfer is created.

Refer to our [idempotency key](#idempotency-key) section to learn more.

### HTTP request

`POST https://api.dwolla.com/transfers`

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |

## Retrieve a transfer failure reason

When a bank transfer fails for an Account or Customer, Dwolla returns a `failure` link when [retrieving the transfer by its Id](#retrieve-a-transfer). This failure link is used to retrieve the ACH return code and description. For reference, the list of possible failure codes and descriptions are shown in the [Transfer failures](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/bank-transfer-workflow/transfer-failures.html) resource article.

**Note:** If a transfer fails to/from a bank account then the `bank` will automatically be removed from the Dwolla system for all ACH return codes except `R01`, `R09` and `R20`.

### HTTP Request
`GET https://api.dwolla.com/transfers/{id}/failure`

  .then(res => res.body.code); // => 'R01'
```

## Cancel a transfer

When a bank transfer is eligible for cancellation, Dwolla returns a `cancel` link  when [getting the transfer by Id](#retrieve-a-transfer). This cancel link is used to trigger the cancellation, preventing the bank transfer from processing further. A bank transfer is cancellable up until 4pm CT on that same business day if the transfer was initiated prior to 4pm CT. If a transfer was initiated after 4pm CT, it can be cancelled before 4pm CT on the following business day. **Note:** This is not a hard cut off. Occasionally, the export out of the Dwolla Network may be delayed or could take some time to process. This may cause transfers created close to after 4pm CT to be exported the same business day. It is recommended to rely on the `cancel` link returned on the transfer resource to determine if a transfer is cancellable rather than relying on the export timing. 

### HTTP Request

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |

## Create an on-demand transfer authorization

This section outlines how to create an on-demand bank transfer authorization for your Customer. On-demand authorization allows Customers to authorize Dwolla to transfer variable amounts from their bank account using ACH at a later point in time for products or services delivered. This on-demand authorization is supplied along with the Customer's bank details when creating a [new Customer funding source](#create-a-funding-source-for-a-customer).

When on-demand authorization is enabled for your application the Customer is presented with text on a “add bank account” screen in your user interface(UI) giving authorization to Dwolla for future variable payments. **Note:** On-demand payments come as part of our Dwolla API and requires additional approval before getting started. Please [contact Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs) or your account manager for more information on enabling.
