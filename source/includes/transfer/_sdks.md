# SDK Support

The Dwolla API has officially maintained software packages to make it easier for developers to get started with making requests. This section is here to provide basic instructions on how to install these packages and get up and running with them. We recommend you use a POSIX-standardized shell on your development machine, and assume that you are already familiar and set-up with any tools required for your specific technical ecosystem.

Officially maintained SDKs are available for Ruby, Node.js, Python, and C#.

The PHP SDK is autogenerated by [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/mach-kernel/swagger-codegen) and are versioned in accordance with our API schema. Each endpoint grouping is assigned a class and then an operation which you can use to make a request. You can choose which environment to target (e.g production vs sandbox) by providing the SDK a different API host value. These libraries are not actively maintained, therefore we encourage community contribution.

app_key = "..."
app_secret = "..."
$dwolla = DwollaV2::Client.new(key: app_key, secret: app_secret) do |config|
  config.environment = :sandbox # optional - defaults to production
end

account_token = $dwolla.tokens.new access_token: "...", refresh_token: "..."

account_url = 'https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/accounts/dee319e6-26d0-4dc6-a5bf-f1e0f4c677ad'
